# Arch Technologies – Data Science Internship

This repository contains my work completed during the **Data Science Internship at Arch Technologies**. It includes hands-on tasks and projects focused on **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and basic machine learning** using Python libraries such as **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

## Internship Overview
During the internship, I worked with **real-world datasets** to:

- Clean and preprocess data  
- Explore data and extract meaningful insights  
- Visualize trends and patterns  
- Apply basic machine learning models  

The projects demonstrate **end-to-end data analysis workflows**, from raw data handling to insights generation, enhancing my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Skills Developed:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Visualization, Feature Analysis, Basic ML
